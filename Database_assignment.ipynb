        "# ### **2. What makes MongoDB a good choice for modern applications?**\n",
        "\n",
        "# - **Scalability**: Supports horizontal scaling via sharding.\n",
        "# - **Flexibility**: Schema-less design allows dynamic document structures.\n",

        "# | Feature   | Sharding | Replication |\n",
        "# |-----------|---------|-------------|\n",
        "# | **Purpose** | Distributes data across multiple servers | Ensures data redundancy |\n",
        "# | **Scaling** | Horizontal scaling | High availability |\n",
        "# | **Components** | Shard servers, Config servers, Query routers | Primary and secondary nodes |\n",
        "\n",
        "# ### **9. What is PyMongo, and why is it used?**\n",
        "\n",
        "# - PyMongo is the **Python driver for MongoDB**.\n",
        "# - Used to interact with MongoDB using Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "# ### **10. What are the ACID properties in the context of MongoDB transactions?**\n",
        "\n",
        "# - **Atomicity**: Operations are all-or-nothing.\n",
        "# - **Consistency**: Ensures valid state transitions.\n",
        "# - **Isolation**: Transactions don’t interfere.\n",
        "# - **Durability**: Data is permanently stored.\n",
        "\n",
        "# ### **11. What is the purpose of MongoDB’s `explain()` function?**\n",
        "\n",
        "# - Analyzes query execution plans.\n",

        "# MongoDB offers several security mechanisms:\n",
        "# - **Authentication & Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict database operations.\n",
        "# - **TLS/SSL Encryption**: Secures data in transit.\n",
        "# - **Encryption at Rest**: Protects stored data.\n",

        "# - Enhances **read performance** by reducing queries but increases document size.\n",
        "\n",
        "# ### **16. What is the purpose of MongoDB’s `$lookup` stage in aggregation?**\n",
        "# - Performs **joins** between collections similar to SQL JOIN.\n",
        "# - Used to fetch related data from different collections.\n",
        "# - Example:\n",
        "#   ```json\n",
        "#   {\n",
        "#     \"$lookup\": {\n",
        "#       \"from\": \"orders\",\n",
        "#       \"localField\": \"customer_id\",\n",

        "# - **Enable authentication** using username-password.\n",
        "# - **Use IP whitelisting** to restrict access.\n",
        "# - **Enable TLS/SSL encryption** for secure communication.\n",
        "# - **Apply role-based access control (RBAC)**.\n",
